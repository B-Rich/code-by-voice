code-by-voice
=============

In this repository you will find all the support files for my "code by voice" setup using Dragon Naturally Speaking and DragonFly. I was inspired to do this by Tavis Rudd (https://github.com/tavisrudd). You can see his excelent presentation from PyCon here: http://youtu.be/8SkdfdXWYaI

### !!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

## Requirements

* Dragnon Naturally Speaking - You can use any edition (including home). The advantage of using the Premium Edition, based on talking to the rep from Nuance, is that the Premium edition will let you backup the voice traning directly from DNS.
* Windows 7
* DragonFly
* Python 2.6
* Virtualization Software (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels) if you are setting this up on Mac OS X or Linux
